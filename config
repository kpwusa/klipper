# This file serves as documentation for config parameters. One may
# copy and edit this file to configure a new cartesian style
# printer. For delta style printers, see the "example-delta.cfg"
# file. For corexy/h-bot style printers, see the "example-corexy.cfg"
# file. Only common config sections are described here - see the
# "example-extras.cfg" file for configuring less common devices.

# DO NOT COPY THIS FILE WITHOUT CAREFULLY READING AND UPDATING IT
# FIRST. Incorrectly configured parameters may cause damage.

# A note on pin names: pins may be configured with a hardware name
# (such as "PA4") or with an Arduino alias name (such as "ar29" or
# "analog3"). In order to use Arduino names, the pin_map variable in
# the mcu section must be present and have a value of "arduino". Pin
# names may be preceded by an '!' to indicate that a reverse polarity
# should be used (eg, trigger on low instead of high). Input pins may
# be preceded by a '^' to indicate that a hardware pull-up resistor
# should be enabled for the pin. If the micro-controller supports
# pull-down resistors then an input pin may alternatively be preceded
# by a '~'.


# The stepper_x section is used to describe the stepper controlling
# the X axis in a cartesian robot.

#   extruder. This parameter must be provided.
#max_extrude_cross_section:
#   Maximum area (in mm^2) of an extrusion cross section (eg,
#   extrusion width multiplied by layer height). This setting prevents
#   excessive amounts of extrusion during relatively small XY moves.
#   If a move requests an extrusion rate that would exceed this value
#   it will cause an error to be returned. The default is: 4.0 *
#   nozzle_diameter^2
#max_extrude_only_distance: 50.0
#   Maximum length (in mm of raw filament) that a retraction or
#   extrude-only move may have. If a retraction or extrude-only move
#   requests a distance greater than this value it will cause an error

#max_extrude_only_velocity:
#max_extrude_only_accel:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) and acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the
#   extruder motor for retractions and extrude-only moves. These
#   settings do not place any limit on normal printing moves. If not
#   specified then they are calculated to match the limit an XY
#   printing move with a cross section of 4.0*nozzle_diameter^2 would
#   have.
#pressure_advance: 0.0
#   The amount of raw filament to push into the extruder during
#   extruder acceleration. An equal amount of filament is retracted

#   advance.
#pressure_advance_lookahead_time: 0.010
#   A time (in seconds) to "look ahead" at future extrusion moves when

#   PWM output pin controlling the heater. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   heater_pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set
#   fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would
#   allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This
#   setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended
#   periods) to the heater. The default is 1.0.

#   thermistor. The default is 4700 ohms.
#inline_resistor: 0
#   The resistance (in ohms) of an extra (not heat varying) resistor
#   that is placed inline with the thermistor. It is rare to set this.
#   This parameter is only valid when the sensor is a thermistor. The
#   default is 0 ohms.
#adc_voltage: 5.0
#   The ADC comparison voltage. This parameter is only valid when the
#   sensor is an AD595 or "PT100 INA826". The default is 5 volts.
#smooth_time: 2.0
#   A time value (in seconds) over which temperature measurements will
#   be smoothed to reduce the impact of measurement noise. The default
#   is 2 seconds.
control: pid
#   Control algorithm (either pid or watermark). This parameter must
#   be provided.
pid_Kp: 17.769
#   Kp is the "proportional" constant for the pid. This parameter must
#   be provided for PID heaters.
pid_Ki: 0.49
#   Ki is the "integral" constant for the pid. This parameter must be
#   provided for PID heaters.
pid_Kd: 161.25
#   Kd is the "derivative" constant for the pid. This parameter must
#   be provided for PID heaters.
#pid_integral_max:
#   The maximum "windup" the integral term may accumulate. The default
#   is to use the same value as max_power.
#pwm_cycle_time: 0.100
#   Time in seconds for each software PWM cycle of the heater. It is
#   not recommended to set this unless there is an electrical
#   requirement to switch the heater faster than 10 times a second.
#   The default is 0.100 seconds.
#min_extrude_temp: 170
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) at which extruder move
#   commands may be issued. The default is 170 Celsius.
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 250
#   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
#   heater must remain within. This controls a safety feature
#   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
#   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller
#   will go into a shutdown state. This check can help detect some
#   heater and sensor hardware failures. Set this range just wide
#   enough so that reasonable temperatures do not result in an
#   error. These parameters must be provided.

# The heater_bed section describes a heated bed (if present - omit
# section if not present).
[heater_bed]
heater_pin: ar8
sensor_type: EPCOS 100K B57560G104F
sensor_pin: analog14
control: watermark
#max_delta: 2.0
#   On 'watermark' controlled heaters this is the number of degrees in
#   Celsius above the target temperature before disabling the heater
#   as well as the number of degrees below the target before
#   re-enabling the heater. The default is 2 degrees Celsius.
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 110

# Print cooling fan (omit section if fan not present).
[fan]
pin: ar9
#   PWM output pin controlling the fan. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully
#   enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the
#   pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This setting may
#   be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to
#   the fan. If this value is less than 1.0 then fan speed requests
#   will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if
#   max_power is .9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested then the fan
#   power will be set to 72%). The default is 1.0.
#shutdown_speed: 0
#   The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if
#   the micro-controller software enters an error state. The default
#   is 0.
#cycle_time: 0.010
#   The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the
#   fan. It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when
#   using software based PWM. The default is 0.010 seconds.
#hardware_pwm: False
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. Most fans
#   do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to
#   enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at
#   very high speeds. When using hardware PWM the actual cycle time is
#   constrained by the implementation and may be significantly
#   different than the requested cycle_time. The default is False.
kick_start_time: 0.100
#   Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when first enabling
#   it (helps get the fan spinning). The default is 0.100 seconds.

# Micro-controller information.
[mcu]
serial: /dev/ttyACM0
#   The serial port to connect to the MCU. If unsure (or if it
#   changes) see the "Where's my serial port?" section of the FAQ. The
#   default is /dev/ttyS0
#baud: 250000
#   The baud rate to use. The default is 250000.
pin_map: arduino
#   This option may be used to enable Arduino pin name aliases. The
#   default is to not enable the aliases.
#restart_method:
#   This controls the mechanism the host will use to reset the
#   micro-controller. The choices are 'arduino', 'rpi_usb', and
#   'command'. The 'arduino' method (toggle DTR) is common on Arduino
#   boards and clones. The 'rpi_usb' method is useful on Raspberry Pi
#   boards with micro-controllers powered over USB - it briefly
#   disables power to all USB ports to accomplish a micro-controller
#   reset. The 'command' method involves sending a Klipper command to
#   the micro-controller so that it can reset itself. The default is
#   'arduino' if the micro-controller communicates over a serial port,
#   'command' otherwise.

# The printer section controls high level printer settings.
[printer]
kinematics: cartesian
#   This option must be "cartesian" for cartesian printers.
max_velocity: 500
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
max_accel: 3000
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
#max_accel_to_decel:
#   A pseudo acceleration (in mm/s^2) controlling how fast the
#   toolhead may go from acceleration to deceleration. It is used to
#   reduce the top speed of short zig-zag moves (and thus reduce
#   printer vibration from these moves). The default is half of
#   max_accel.
max_z_velocity: 5
#   For cartesian printers this sets the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   movement along the z axis. This setting can be used to restrict
#   the maximum speed of the z stepper motor on cartesian
#   printers. The default is to use max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
max_z_accel: 30
#   For cartesian printers this sets the maximum acceleration (in
#   mm/s^2) of movement along the z axis. It limits the acceleration
#   of the z stepper motor on cartesian printers. The default is to
#   use max_accel for max_z_accel.
#square_corner_velocity: 5.0
#   The maximum velocity (in mm/s) that the toolhead may travel a 90
#   degree corner at. A non-zero value can reduce changes in extruder
#   flow rates by enabling instantaneous velocity changes of the
#   toolhead during cornering. This value configures the internal
#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The default is 5mm/s.

# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.  When

#
[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#bed_radius:
#   Defines the radius to probe for round beds.  Note that the radius
#   is relative to the nozzle's origin, if using a probe be sure to
#   account for its offset.  This parameter must be provided for round
#   beds and omitted for rectangular beds.
min_point: 30,65
#   Defines the minimum x,y position to probe when for rectangular
#   beds. Note that this refers to the nozzle position, take care that
#   you do not define a point that will move the probe off of the bed.
#   This parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
max_point: 195,180
#   Defines the maximum x,y position to probe when for rectangular
#   beds. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point. Also note
#   that this does not necessarily define the last point probed, only
#   the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
#probe_count: 3,3
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values (X,Y) defining the number of points to probe along each axis.
#   A single value is also valid, in which case that value will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 3,3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this is integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled.  Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes.  When set
#   to a value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be
#   noted that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a
#   print.  If a user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is
#   recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0

#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.


# Heater cooling fans (one may define any number of sections with a

#   specified then the hardware must have a pull-up on the
#   corresponding lcd line.
#menu_root:
#   Entry point for menu, root menu container name. If this parameter
#   is not provided then default menu root is used. When provided
#   menu entry is 'deck' type then it'll be initiated immediately at startup.
#   Description of menu items is located in example-menu.cfg file.
#menu_timeout:
#   Timeout for menu. Being inactive this amount of seconds will trigger
#   menu exit or return to root menu when having autorun enabled.
#   The default is 0 seconds (disabled)
#encoder_pins: ^ar75, ^ar73 
#   The pins connected to encoder. 2 pins must be provided when
#   using encoder. This parameter must be provided when using menu.
#click_pin:
#   The pin connected to 'enter' button or encoder 'click'. This parameter
#   must be provided when using menu. The presence of an 'analog_range_click_pin'
#   config parameter turns this parameter from digital to analog.
#back_pin:
#   The pin connected to 'back' button. This parameter is optional, menu
#   can be used without it. The presence of an 'analog_range_back_pin'
#   config parameter turns this parameter from digital to analog.
#up_pin:
#   The pin connected to 'up' button. This parameter must be provided
#   when using menu without encoder. The presence of an 'analog_range_up_pin'
#   config parameter turns this parameter from digital to analog.
